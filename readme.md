# Song Dynasty Paintings Database (Work-in-Progress)

last updated April 5th, 2021

This database contains extant paintings that are dated to the period between the early tenth century and the first three-quarters of the 13th century in China. The term, painting, is narrowly defined as a portable artifact with ink or color pigment applied with a brush on silk or paper. This definition of painting excludes other contemporary image-bearing mediums such as murals, ink rubbings, and woodblock imprints. 

## Attributes

## Dynastic Tags
Since only a proportion of works have a definite date of origin, I used approximate periodization based on the scholars’ consensus in published sources. There are seven categories of periodization: 

- S0: Unspecified period in the Northern Song (960-1127); 
- NS1: Early to mid-Northern Song (960-1050); 
- NS2: Mid to late-Northern Song (1050-1127); 
- SS0: Unspecified period in the Southern Song (1127-1279); 
- SS1: Early to mid-Southern Song (1127-1200); 
- SS2: Mid to late-Southern Song (1200-1279); 
- S: Unspecified period between the Northern and Southern Song (960-1279). 

## Size Tags
- Small (S): both height and width measured under 55 cm
- Medium (M): both height and width measured between 55 to 110 cm
- Large (L): both height and width measured between 110 to 220 cm
- Extra large/long  (XL): height or width exceeds 220 cm
